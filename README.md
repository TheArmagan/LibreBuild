**LibreBuild** is a Minecraft plugin that allows **players and administrators** to place schematic files (`.schem`) easily, making building more accessible for everyone. Whether you're an admin managing world structures or a player wanting a pre-built house, LibreBuild has you covered!

## Features
✔️ **Easy schematic placement** - Load and place schematics with a simple item.  
✔️ **Admin & Player roles** - Admins manage schematics, players place them.  
✔️ **WorldGuard protection** - Prevents griefing by checking for protected areas.  
✔️ **Multi-language support** - English, Spanish, French, Russian, Dutch.  
✔️ **Customizable blueprints** - Define what schematics players can use.

## 📥 Installation

1. **Download the plugin** from the [Releases](https://github.com/your-repo/releases) section.  
2. Place `LibreBuild.jar` into your server’s `plugins/` folder.
3. Don't forget to install **WorldEdit** and **WorldGuard**. (Minimum version: 7.3.9 and 7.0.9 tested)
4. Restart your server.  
5. (Optional) Configure settings in `config.yml`.

## 🎮 How It Works
